# files

This project aims to be a scaffolding for [Files app](https://www.files.gallery/). It allows to have a development environment and sync contents with a production server.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a `contents` folder where the contents will stay.
3. If you plan to maintain your custom Files app in a production server, create a `.env` file with the following settings:

| Setting                   | Description                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| LICENSE_KEY\*             | License key for Files app                                |
| SSH_USER                  | User on production server                                |
| HOST                      | Hostname on production server                            |
| REMOTE_CONTENTS_PATH      | Full path where contents are stored in production server |
| REMOTE_CONTENTS_CHMOD\*\* | Permissions for contents folder in production server     |

\*Only if purchased.

\*\*Permission in the UNIX format (777). Keep in mind when you request zip download (it has to be the proper permissions on folders).
